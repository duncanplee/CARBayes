Description: Implements a class of univariate and multivariate spatial generalised linear mixed models for areal unit data, with inference in a Bayesian setting using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation. The response variable can be binomial, Gaussian, multinomial, Poisson or zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP), and spatial autocorrelation is modelled by a set of random effects that are assigned a conditional autoregressive (CAR) prior distribution. A number of different models are available for univariate spatial data, including models with no random effects as well as random effects modelled by different types of CAR prior, including the BYM model (Besag et al. (1991) <doi:10.1007/BF00116466>), the Leroux model (Leroux et al. (2000) <doi:10.1007/978-1-4612-1284-3_4>) and the localised model (Lee et al. (2015) <doi:10.1002/env.2348>). Additionally,  a multivariate CAR (MCAR) model for multivariate spatial data is available, as is a two-level hierarchical model for modelling data relating to individuals within areas. Full details are given in the vignette accompanying this package.
